LECTURE 1

RShiny is reactive, meaning that the UI changes immediately
The server component is very short, all it does is run stuff on server
ShinyApp component is the shortest, notall that's done here is the running of the app

UI contains, theme, and navbar page
  This holds the tabpanel, which is the page we are on
  In this we have the side panel (input) and the main panel (results)

LECTURE 2

Since there ar e3 parts to each app (ui, server, and shinyapp)
This app aims to look at the wind level in the airquality dataset in a histogram form

LECTURE 3

Create a golf random forest model taht looks at inputs of weather outlook, temperature, humidity, and windiness and gives an output from this
The sidebar panel uses 4 inputs, an dthe main output has a text and table output

LECTURE 4

Here we make a model first, then make the app

We use an "action" button to override the reactive-ness of R

LECTURE 5

We want to show a bmi calculator with an about page also
